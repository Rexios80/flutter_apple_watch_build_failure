# apple_watch_test

An example project showing that newly generated Apple Watch targets fail to build with flutter

## Getting Started

Build with flutter 2.10.1

To see the failure:
 - Checkout the master branch
 - Run `flutter build ios`

To see the workaround
 - Checkout the workaround branch
 - Run `flutter build ios`

The workaround should be unnecessary once the issue is fixed in flutter
